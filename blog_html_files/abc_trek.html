            <br>

            This was my first-ever trek. The journey to Annapurna Base Camp in Nepal was filled with excitement, challenges, and unforgettable experiences. It all started with an orientation session organized by the Adventure Sports Club at IIT Kanpur. Motivated by visuals from past treks, I joined the conditioning sessions that began the next morning. These sessions involved running and exercising for about 1.5 hours every morning, guided by the club members. Initially, balancing this with classes was tough, but it gradually became a daily routine. We finished the conditioning with a 10km cross-country run. After one and a half months of rigorous training, our team of 13 members set off from campus, eager to explore the Himalayan landscapes.

            Our journey commenced with a bus ride from Kanpur to Lucknow, followed by an unexpected bus journey from Lucknow to Gorakhpur after missing our train. From Gorakhpur, we crossed the Sinauli border by bus and arrived in Pokhara, where we spent our first night. The following morning, we traveled from Pokhara to the village of Ghandruk, our trek's starting point. The bus ride to Ghandruk was both exciting and a bit scary, with the bus rocking back and forth as we enjoyed the stunning views of the landscape. <br> <br>
            
            This was October 2022, and the festival of Dussehra was approaching. Dussehra is known as Dashain in Nepal. Dashain is the most widely celebrated festival in Nepal. The local tradition involves collecting donations for the festival through lively music performances and dance. At Ghandruk, on that night our team enthusiastically participated in this unique fundraising effort, joining the local community in their festivities. That evening in Nepal was filled with joy and camaraderie, making it a memorable and enjoyable experience for all. <br> 
            <br>

            After spending the night in Ghandruk, we started our trek. The journey was filled with continuous climbs and descents on staircases, surrounded by majestic mountains and peaceful natural beauty. The first day was especially exhausting; we walked for over 6 hours under the harsh sun, carrying backpacks weighing nearly 14 kilograms. We took breaks to drink water, replenish electrolytes, and enjoy some chocolates, knowing that staying hydrated is crucial in the mountains. On our initial day, we arrived at Chhomrong, situated at an altitude of 2170 meters.

            The next day, we started from Chhomrong and after trekking for 8-9 hours, we reached Deurali. It was a sunny day, just as challenging as the first, but we loved the beautiful scenery along the way. When we finally got to where we were staying, we had dinner together. It wasn't the best dinner, though, because after eating rice and boiled greens for four days straight, we were tired of it. Dinner was followed by playing cards and night walks. <br>
            <br>

            On the third day, we left Deurali and headed to ABC, which took about 9-10 hours of trekking. It started raining that day, and even though we had raincoats, we got wet pretty quickly. The hardest part was walking with wet shoes on that hilly terrain. Along the way, we crossed 3-4 waterfalls with fast-flowing water, which we had to be really careful with because of the rain. Finally, we made it to ABC. Seeing the sign for Annapurna Base Camp was like a dream come true. After three days of trekking through the harsh sun, cold weather, rain, and tough paths, it felt amazing to reach our goal. Although it was snowing heavily and we couldn't see the full view of the mountains, the snowy base camp looked incredibly peaceful.

            The next day, we began our journey back. Along the way, we stopped at Jhinu, where we bathed in a hot spring. It was the best part of our trek, an indescribable experience sitting in the hot spring with light rain falling, a river flowing nearby, and mountains all aroundâ€”it felt heavenly. <br> <br>
            
            On our final day in Nepal, we explored Pokhara by cycling around the city. It's a beautiful city. We visited the Gupteshwar Mahadev cave and savored some of Pokhara's delicious dishes.

            This trek was an incredible experience for me, both enriching and highly enjoyable. Each day presented its own challenges and rewardsâ€”narrow trails, rushing waterfalls, harsh sun, heavy rain, and biting cold. Every step tested our resilience and unity as a team. Together, we successfully completed the trek, each of us moving at our own paceâ€”some fast, some moderate, and some slowerâ€”but all contributing to our collective achievement. <br>
            <br>
            The moments we shared during breaks and evenings, after meeting our daily goals, will be cherished forever. This journey was more than just a physical adventure; it enriched my perspective and gratitude for the wonders of nature.
