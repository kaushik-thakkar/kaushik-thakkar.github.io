                <i> classification. It demonstrates how these functions can capture multi-modality in data clouds, which traditional depth functions like half-space and spatial depth cannot. Two such novel depth measures—sphere depth and kernelized spatial depth—derived from kernelized half-space and spatial depth are introduced which captures the multi-modality of the data cloud. These depth measures are used as features for classification, capturing data structure in a non-parametric manner. The project compares the effectiveness of these depth-based features in binary classification tasks using machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, K-nearest neighbors, and generalized additive models. It simulates data from four location and scale models, including multivariate normal and t distributions, builds classifiers based on depth values, and evaluates their performance on training and test data.</i>

Ensuring AI systems can handle OOD examples and flag those requiring human intervention is crucial, especially in safety-critical domains such as medicine and finance. In this project I evaluated several OOD detection methods e.g. Mahalanobis method, KL-Matching, energy/entropy based methods etc. on state-of-the-art datasets. Compared these methods with the method developed by CAIR. Assessed the competence of different OOD detection methods in identifying non-believable samples.</i>

                <i> short-term mispricing between similar stocks. This project focuses on identifying stock pairs that exhibit a long-term price relationship, typically moving together due to similar exposure to risks or common underlying economic factors. By analyzing historical data and identifying these co-integrated stocks, we can develop a trading strategy that capitalizes on temporary price divergences. When one stock in a pair is undervalued and the other is overvalued, a long position is taken on the undervalued stock and a short position on the overvalued one, with the expectation that prices will revert to their historical relationship. The project aims to identify co-integrated stocks from major economic sectors, build a trading strategy using moving averages, and optimize the threshold for trading signals to maximize profits. The strategy is tested to estimate potential profitability.</i>
